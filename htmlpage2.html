        There’s something I’ve been keeping in my heart for quite some time now, and I think it’s finally time I let it out. 
        <br />Even though we don’t talk, and even though we’re not close, you’ve managed to become someone who matters to me more than I ever expected.
        <br />It’s strange how someone can mean so much without even realizing it—but that’s exactly what happened with you.
        <b><mark>Every time I see you, the world seems to pause for a moment.</mark></b> 
        <br />It’s like everything else fades into the background, and all I notice is you—your smile, your presence, the way you light up the space around you without even trying. 
        <br /><mark>You’ve unknowingly become my favorite part of the day</mark>, the quiet thought that makes me smile even when no one’s around.
        <ins><strong>I admire you deeply,</strong></ins> not just for the way you look—<br />though I could write pages about that alone—but for the way you carry this warmth that feels rare and genuine.
        There’s a gentleness about you that draws me in, 
        <br />and it makes me want to know more—the little details, the dreams you hold, the stories you’ve lived through. 
        You’ve captured my heart without even speaking to me,
        <br />and that’s something I can’t ignore anymore.
        I don’t expect anything from you, nor do I want to rush anything. 
        <br />I just wanted you to know that somewhere, quietly, there is someone who thinks of you in the sweetest way, who hopes for your happiness,
        <br />and who wishes for even the smallest chance to get to know you.
        If fate ever allows it, I’d love for us to share even just a simple conversation. 
        <br />Who knows—maybe something beautiful could grow from there.
        Until then, I’ll keep carrying this feeling in my heart, <mark>thankful that someone as wonderful as you exists in this world</mark>. 
        <br />And whether or not you ever feel the same way, please know that you are admired in the purest, most genuine way.
    </p>

        I’ve been honest about my feelings… now I’m curious if I caught your attention too.
